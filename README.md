# jsPsych2150 Experiments Repository

Welcome to the jsPsych2150 repository! This repository contains demos of cognitive psychology experiments developed for the PSY2150 Research Methods course. The experiments are implemented using jsPsych, a JavaScript library for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser.

1.	**Free Recall Experiment (free_recall.html)**: Participants study a list of words and then recall as many as they can within a time limit.
2.	**Recognition Memory Experiment (recognition.html)**: Participants study a list of words and then are tested on their recognition of previously seen (old) words versus new words.
3.	**Image Recognition Experiment (image_recognition.html)**: Similar to the recognition experiment but uses images instead of words.
